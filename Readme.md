#Where to start

Feel free to peek into Interface.Xaml.CS for the true 'entry point',
but I have attempted to break up classes into their own files this time.
Hopefully that makes it easier to read through.

#Synopsis

This program will replace about 10 minutes of work per product we deliver.
This may only eat up 2 hours per day, but it's a big enough deal to us.
The program will take user input for a work week and then scan our network
for all jobs done that week. It can call upon error reporting, SFTP uploads,
automatic e-mail and LAN delivery, digitally signed jobs, and other useful
functions. This reduces time per job to around 1 minute.
